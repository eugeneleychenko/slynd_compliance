Whether you’ve never taken birth control before, have experience with estrogen-free birth control, or are more familiar with pills that do contain estrogen, we’re guessing you probably have some questions. Take a look at the FAQs our experts have gathered below, or head to our Resources section for even more information.\n  What is Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) also called a POP (progestin only pill) that is used by females who can become pregnant to prevent pregnancy.\n  How does Slynd® work for contraception?\n  + Slynd ® is effective at preventing pregnancy. Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. Based on the results of one clinical study of a 28-day regimen of Slynd ® about 4 out of 100 females may get pregnant within the first year they use Slynd ® .\n  Who should not take Slynd®?\n  + You should not take Slynd ® if you have kidney disease or kidney failure, reduced adrenal gland function (adrenal insufficiency), have or have had cervical cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones, liver disease, including liver tumors or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or have had any of these conditions. Your health care provider can suggest a different method of birth control.\n  How should I take Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® (white active and green inactive tablets) is swallowed whole once a day. Take one tablet daily for 28 consecutive days; one white active tablet daily during the first 24 days and one green inactive tablet daily during the 4 following days. Tablets must be taken every day at about the same time of the day so that the interval between two tablets is always 24 hours.\n  When can I start taking Slynd®?\n  + If you start taking Slynd ® and you are not currently using a hormonal birth control method: Start Slynd ® on the first day (Day 1) of your natural menstrual period (Day 1 Start). Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking your birth control pill. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from another birth control pill: Start your new Slynd ® blister pack on the same day that you would start the next pack of your previous birth control method. Do not continue taking the pills from your previous birth control pack. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a vaginal ring or transdermal patch: Start taking Slynd ® on the day you would have inserted the next ring or applied the next patch. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a progestin only method such as an implant or injection: Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your implant or on the day when you would have had your next injection. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from an intrauterine device or system (IUD or IUS): Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your IUD or IUS.\n  What if I want to become pregnant?\n  + You may stop taking Slynd ® whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking Slynd ® .\n  What are possible serious side effects of Slynd®?\n  + SLYND may cause serious side effects, including:\n  High potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia). Certain medicines and conditions can also increase the potassium levels in your blood. Your healthcare provider may check the potassium levels in your blood before and during treatment with SLYND. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away if you have signs or symptoms of high potassium levels in your blood including: weakness or numbness in an arm or leg. palpitations (feel like your heart is racing or fluttering) or irregular heartbeat. nausea. vomiting. severe pain in your chest. shortness of breath.\n  Blood clot forming in blood vessels. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a blood clot. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have surgery or are not able to be active due to illness or injury. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital or emergency room right away if you have: leg pain that will not go away. a sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches. sudden, severe shortness of breath. sudden change in vision or blindness. chest pain. weakness or numbness in your arm or leg. trouble speaking.\n  Bone loss. Cervical Cancer. Liver problems, including liver tumors. Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in your tubes). This is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. If you have severe abdominal pain, call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away.\n  Risk of high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Changes in menstrual bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have changes in menstrual bleeding.\n  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past.\n  What are the most common side effects of Slynd®?\n  + The most common side effects of Slynd ® include acne, headache, breast pain and tenderness, weight gain, menstrual cramps, nausea, severe vaginal bleeding and less sexual desire. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n  What should I know about my period when taking Slynd®?\n  + As with some other oral contraceptives, when you take Slynd ® , you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unscheduled bleeding. This is common and may occur during the first few months of use. With continued use, you may not experience periods at all while taking Slynd ® . If you experience changes in menstrual bleeding, call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.\n  What if I don’t have my scheduled period while taking Slynd®?\n  + Slynd may cause changes in bleeding patterns, especially during the first three months of use. These bleeding irregularities may resolve over time. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, contact your healthcare provider. If you miss a period and have not taken Slynd according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Slynd.\n  What should I do if I miss any Slynd® pills?\n  + If one white active tablet is missed, take the missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. If two or more white active tablets are missed, take the last missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue one tablet a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed tablet(s) will remain in the blister pack). Use a non-hormonal back-up birth control method (like a condom or spermicide) if you have sex during the first 7 days after missing your pills. You do not need to take 1 or more missed green pills. Take the green pill at your next regular time, every day until you finish the pack (this means 1 or more missed green pills will remain the blister pack).\n  Is Slynd right for you?

Whether you’ve never taken birth control before, have experience with estrogen-free birth control, or are more familiar with pills that do contain estrogen, we’re guessing you probably have some questions. Take a look at the FAQs our experts have gathered below, or head to our Resources section for even more information.\n  What is Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) also called a POP (progestin only pill) that is used by females who can become pregnant to prevent pregnancy.\n  How does Slynd® work for contraception?\n  + Slynd ® is effective at preventing pregnancy. Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. Based on the results of one clinical study of a 28-day regimen of Slynd ® about 4 out of 100 females may get pregnant within the first year they use Slynd ® .\n  Who should not take Slynd®?\n  + You should not take Slynd ® if you have kidney disease or kidney failure, reduced adrenal gland function (adrenal insufficiency), have or have had cervical cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones, liver disease, including liver tumors or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or have had any of these conditions. Your health care provider can suggest a different method of birth control.\n  How should I take Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® (white active and green inactive tablets) is swallowed whole once a day. Take one tablet daily for 28 consecutive days; one white active tablet daily during the first 24 days and one green inactive tablet daily during the 4 following days. Tablets must be taken every day at about the same time of the day so that the interval between two tablets is always 24 hours.\n  When can I start taking Slynd®?\n  + If you start taking Slynd ® and you are not currently using a hormonal birth control method: Start Slynd ® on the first day (Day 1) of your natural menstrual period (Day 1 Start). Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking your birth control pill. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from another birth control pill: Start your new Slynd ® blister pack on the same day that you would start the next pack of your previous birth control method. Do not continue taking the pills from your previous birth control pack. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a vaginal ring or transdermal patch: Start taking Slynd ® on the day you would have inserted the next ring or applied the next patch. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a progestin only method such as an implant or injection: Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your implant or on the day when you would have had your next injection. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from an intrauterine device or system (IUD or IUS): Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your IUD or IUS.\n  What if I want to become pregnant?\n  + You may stop taking Slynd ® whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking Slynd ® .\n  What are possible serious side effects of Slynd®?\n  + SLYND may cause serious side effects, including:\n  High potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia). Certain medicines and conditions can also increase the potassium levels in your blood. Your healthcare provider may check the potassium levels in your blood before and during treatment with SLYND. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away if you have signs or symptoms of high potassium levels in your blood including: weakness or numbness in an arm or leg. palpitations (feel like your heart is racing or fluttering) or irregular heartbeat. nausea. vomiting. severe pain in your chest. shortness of breath.\n  Blood clot forming in blood vessels. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a blood clot. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have surgery or are not able to be active due to illness or injury. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital or emergency room right away if you have: leg pain that will not go away. a sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches. sudden, severe shortness of breath. sudden change in vision or blindness. chest pain. weakness or numbness in your arm or leg. trouble speaking.\n  Bone loss. Cervical Cancer. Liver problems, including liver tumors. Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in your tubes). This is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. If you have severe abdominal pain, call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away.\n  Risk of high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Changes in menstrual bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have changes in menstrual bleeding.\n  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past.\n  What are the most common side effects of Slynd®?\n  + The most common side effects of Slynd ® include acne, headache, breast pain and tenderness, weight gain, menstrual cramps, nausea, severe vaginal bleeding and less sexual desire. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n  What should I know about my period when taking Slynd®?\n  + As with some other oral contraceptives, when you take Slynd ® , you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unscheduled bleeding. This is common and may occur during the first few months of use. With continued use, you may not experience periods at all while taking Slynd ® . If you experience changes in menstrual bleeding, call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.\n  What if I don’t have my scheduled period while taking Slynd®?\n  + Slynd may cause changes in bleeding patterns, especially during the first three months of use. These bleeding irregularities may resolve over time. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, contact your healthcare provider. If you miss a period and have not taken Slynd according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Slynd.\n  What should I do if I miss any Slynd® pills?\n  + If one white active tablet is missed, take the missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. If two or more white active tablets are missed, take the last missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue one tablet a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed tablet(s) will remain in the blister pack). Use a non-hormonal back-up birth control method (like a condom or spermicide) if you have sex during the first 7 days after missing your pills. You do not need to take 1 or more missed green pills. Take the green pill at your next regular time, every day until you finish the pack (this means 1 or more missed green pills will remain the blister pack).\n  Is Slynd right for you?

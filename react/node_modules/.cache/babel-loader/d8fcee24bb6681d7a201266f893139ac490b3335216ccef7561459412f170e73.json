Whether you’ve never taken birth control before, have experience with estrogen-free birth control, or are more familiar with pills that do contain estrogen, we’re guessing you probably have some questions. Take a look at the FAQs our experts have gathered below, or head to our Resources section for even more information.\n  What is Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) also called a POP (progestin only pill) that is used by females who can become pregnant to prevent pregnancy.\n  How does Slynd® work for contraception?\n  + Slynd ® is effective at preventing pregnancy. Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. Based on the results of one clinical study of a 28-day regimen of Slynd ® about 4 out of 100 females may get pregnant within the first year they use Slynd ® .\n  Who should not take Slynd®?\n  + You should not take Slynd ® if you have kidney disease or kidney failure, reduced adrenal gland function (adrenal insufficiency), have or have had cervical cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones, liver disease, including liver tumors or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or have had any of these conditions. Your health care provider can suggest a different method of birth control.\n  How should I take Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® (white active and green inactive tablets) is swallowed whole once a day. Take one tablet daily for 28 consecutive days; one white active tablet daily during the first 24 days and one green inactive tablet daily during the 4 following days. Tablets must be taken every day at about the same time of the day so that the interval between two tablets is always 24 hours.\n  When can I start taking Slynd®?\n  + If you start taking Slynd ® and you are not currently using a hormonal birth control method: Start Slynd ® on the first day (Day 1) of your natural menstrual period (Day 1 Start). Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking your birth control pill. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from another birth control pill: Start your new Slynd ® blister pack on the same day that you would start the next pack of your previous birth control method. Do not continue taking the pills from your previous birth control pack. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a vaginal ring or transdermal patch: Start taking Slynd ® on the day you would have inserted the next ring or applied the next patch. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a progestin only method such as an implant or injection: Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your implant or on the day when you would have had your next injection. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from an intrauterine device or system (IUD or IUS): Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your IUD or IUS.\n  What if I want to become pregnant?\n  + You may stop taking Slynd ® whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking Slynd ® .\n  What are possible serious side effects of Slynd®?\n  + SLYND may cause serious side effects, including:\n  High potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia). Certain medicines and conditions can also increase the potassium levels in your blood. Your healthcare provider may check the potassium levels in your blood before and during treatment with SLYND. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away if you have signs or symptoms of high potassium levels in your blood including: weakness or numbness in an arm or leg. palpitations (feel like your heart is racing or fluttering) or irregular heartbeat. nausea. vomiting. severe pain in your chest. shortness of breath.\n  Blood clot forming in blood vessels. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a blood clot. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have surgery or are not able to be active due to illness or injury. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital or emergency room right away if you have: leg pain that will not go away. a sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches. sudden, severe shortness of breath. sudden change in vision or blindness. chest pain. weakness or numbness in your arm or leg. trouble speaking.\n  Bone loss. Cervical Cancer. Liver problems, including liver tumors. Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in your tubes). This is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. If you have severe abdominal pain, call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away.\n  Risk of high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Changes in menstrual bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have changes in menstrual bleeding.\n  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past.\n  What are the most common side effects of Slynd®?\n  + The most common side effects of Slynd ® include acne, headache, breast pain and tenderness, weight gain, menstrual cramps, nausea, severe vaginal bleeding and less sexual desire. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n  What should I know about my period when taking Slynd®?\n  + As with some other oral contraceptives, when you take Slynd ® , you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unscheduled bleeding. This is common and may occur during the first few months of use. With continued use, you may not experience periods at all while taking Slynd ® . If you experience changes in menstrual bleeding, call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.\n  What if I don’t have my scheduled period while taking Slynd®?\n  + Slynd may cause changes in bleeding patterns, especially during the first three months of use. These bleeding irregularities may resolve over time. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, contact your healthcare provider. If you miss a period and have not taken Slynd according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Slynd.\n  What should I do if I miss any Slynd® pills?\n  + If one white active tablet is missed, take the missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. If two or more white active tablets are missed, take the last missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue one tablet a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed tablet(s) will remain in the blister pack). Use a non-hormonal back-up birth control method (like a condom or spermicide) if you have sex during the first 7 days after missing your pills. You do not need to take 1 or more missed green pills. Take the green pill at your next regular time, every day until you finish the pack (this means 1 or more missed green pills will remain the blister pack).\n  Is Slynd right for you?

Tell your doctor if you have changes in menstrual bleeding. • Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past.\n  \n  \n  What are the most common side effects of SLYND?\n  • acne • headache • breast pain and tenderness • weight gain • menstrual cramps • nausea • severe vaginal bleeding • less sexual desire\n  \n  These are not all the possible side effects of SLYND.\n  \n  This is not all of the important information about SLYND. \n  \n  Please visit here to read full Prescribing Information: <slynd.com/pi> before starting SLYND.  \n  `;\n  const s3 = `1. **Missed Pill Instructions:** Only if a post references a missed white tablet, include specific instructions.\n  - Example: 'If you missed a white tablet, take it as soon as you remember and then continue taking a pill each day at the same time.'\n\n2. **Severity of Symptoms:** When mentioning severe symptoms, provide urgent recommendations.\n  - Example: For severe symptoms, advise 'seek emergency care or reach out to your healthcare provider' instead of just 'reach out to your healthcare provider.'\n\n3. **Eligibility for Prescription:** Avoid assuming all consumers can get a prescription.\n  - Example: Replace 'Get a prescription' with 'Get evaluated for a prescription.'\n\n4. **Superiority Claims:** Only make superiority claims about the drug's accessibility or delivery method, not composition.\n  - Example: Instead of 'Its about time you consider that upgrade,' use 'Its about time to consider Slynd.'\n\n5. **24-Hour Missed Pill Window:** Always pair mentions of the 24-hour missed pill window with the importance of taking the pill at the same time every day.\n\n6. **Convenience Claims:** When claiming \"convenient,\" specify \"dosing window\" to clarify the context.\n  - Example: 'Slynd offers a convenient dosing window.'\n\n7. **Safety Claims:** Do not claim Slynd is safer than estrogen products without substantial evidence.\n\n8. **Subjective Language:** Use subjective language when discussing birth control choices.\n  - Example: Change 'Age, BMI, and heart rate are factors that impact birth control choice' to 'Age, BMI, and heart rate might be factors you consider when choosing birth control.'\n\n9. Shift claims from being about other birth controls to being specifically about Slynd.\n  - Example: Instead of 'Other birth controls have not been proven effective for high BMI women,' say 'For women with higher BMI, Slynd is effective with no dose adjustment.'\n\n10. **Medical Team Interaction:** Do not invite customers to chat with the medical team in co-pay card advertisements to avoid making them appear as part of the sales and marketing team.\n\n11. **Clarification on Protection:** When using the term \"protection,\" clarify that it does not refer to protection from STDs.\n\n12. **Footnotes and References:** Place footnotes directly beneath the claim and references under the IRI. Footnotes should be marked with an asterisk (*) and accompany the relevant claim.\n   - Example: 'Slynd has a 24-hour missed pill window*.'\n   - *Footnote: 'If you miss a white tablet, take it as soon as you remember and then continue taking a pill each day at the same time.'\n\n13. **Avoiding Superiority Language:** Do not use language that implies Slynd is an upgrade or superior in non-drug-related aspects.\n   - Example: Change 'It's about time you consider that upgrade' to 'It's about time to consider Slynd.'\n\n14. **IRI in Captions:** IRI information is no longer required in text format in the captions if it is shown in the creative.\n\n15. **Inclusive Language:** The phrase 'kind to more kinds of bodies' is used, although not strongly endorsed by PRC, and will not be changed.\n\n16. Only if normal bleedings is mention, Do not say that spotting/unscheduled bleeding is 'normal'; instead, refer to it as 'common.'\n   - Example: 'Spotting or unscheduled bleeding is a common side effect.'\n`;\n  const rule_exceptions = `1. You are allowed to talk about the convenience/speed/comfort of obtaining the drug in question; whether it's not needing to spend time at the pharmacy or not needing to take blood pressure tests. This is not considered a benefit and therefore doesn't need to have a referencing risk.\n  2. Talking about how Slynd doesn't contain estrogen is not a superiority claim.\n  3. Linking back to the website is allowed.\n  4. Slynd being Estrogen is not a superiority claim. \n  5. Link to full risk info is not a benefit\n  6. Social media posts are not public responses.\n  7.

Whether you’ve never taken birth control before, have experience with estrogen-free birth control, or are more familiar with pills that do contain estrogen, we’re guessing you probably have some questions. Take a look at the FAQs our experts have gathered below, or head to our Resources section for even more information.\n  What is Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) also called a POP (progestin only pill) that is used by females who can become pregnant to prevent pregnancy.\n  How does Slynd® work for contraception?\n  + Slynd ® is effective at preventing pregnancy. Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. Based on the results of one clinical study of a 28-day regimen of Slynd ® about 4 out of 100 females may get pregnant within the first year they use Slynd ® .\n  Who should not take Slynd®?\n  + You should not take Slynd ® if you have kidney disease or kidney failure, reduced adrenal gland function (adrenal insufficiency), have or have had cervical cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones, liver disease, including liver tumors or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or have had any of these conditions. Your health care provider can suggest a different method of birth control.\n  How should I take Slynd®?\n  + Slynd ® (white active and green inactive tablets) is swallowed whole once a day. Take one tablet daily for 28 consecutive days; one white active tablet daily during the first 24 days and one green inactive tablet daily during the 4 following days. Tablets must be taken every day at about the same time of the day so that the interval between two tablets is always 24 hours.\n  When can I start taking Slynd®?\n  + If you start taking Slynd ® and you are not currently using a hormonal birth control method: Start Slynd ® on the first day (Day 1) of your natural menstrual period (Day 1 Start). Your healthcare provider should tell you when to start taking your birth control pill. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from another birth control pill: Start your new Slynd ® blister pack on the same day that you would start the next pack of your previous birth control method. Do not continue taking the pills from your previous birth control pack. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a vaginal ring or transdermal patch: Start taking Slynd ® on the day you would have inserted the next ring or applied the next patch. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from a progestin only method such as an implant or injection: Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your implant or on the day when you would have had your next injection. If you start taking Slynd ® and you are switching from an intrauterine device or system (IUD or IUS): Start taking Slynd ® on the day of removal of your IUD or IUS.\n  What if I want to become pregnant?\n  + You may stop taking Slynd ® whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking Slynd ® .\n  What are possible serious side effects of Slynd®?\n  + SLYND may cause serious side effects, including:\n  High potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia). Certain medicines and conditions can also increase the potassium levels in your blood. Your healthcare provider may check the potassium levels in your blood before and during treatment with SLYND. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away if you have signs or symptoms of high potassium levels in your blood including: weakness or numbness in an arm or leg. palpitations (feel like your heart is racing or fluttering) or irregular heartbeat. nausea. vomiting. severe pain in your chest. shortness of breath.\n  Blood clot forming in blood vessels. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had a blood clot. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have surgery or are not able to be active due to illness or injury. Call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital or emergency room right away if you have: leg pain that will not go away. a sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches. sudden, severe shortness of breath. sudden change in vision or blindness. chest pain. weakness or numbness in your arm or leg. trouble speaking.\n  Bone loss. Cervical Cancer. Liver problems, including liver tumors. Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in your tubes). This is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. If you have severe abdominal pain, call your healthcare provider or go to a hospital emergency room right away.\n  Risk of high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Changes in menstrual bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have changes in menstrual bleeding.\n  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past.\n  What are the most common side effects of Slynd®?\n  + The most common side effects of Slynd ® include acne, headache, breast pain and tenderness, weight gain, menstrual cramps, nausea, severe vaginal bleeding and less sexual desire. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n  What should I know about my period when taking Slynd®?\n  + As with some other oral contraceptives, when you take Slynd ® , you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unscheduled bleeding. This is common and may occur during the first few months of use. With continued use, you may not experience periods at all while taking Slynd ® . If you experience changes in menstrual bleeding, call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.\n  What if I don’t have my scheduled period while taking Slynd®?\n  + Slynd may cause changes in bleeding patterns, especially during the first three months of use. These bleeding irregularities may resolve over time. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, contact your healthcare provider. If you miss a period and have not taken Slynd according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Slynd.\n  What should I do if I miss any Slynd® pills?\n  + If one white active tablet is missed, take the missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. If two or more white active tablets are missed, take the last missed tablet as soon as possible. Continue one tablet a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed tablet(s) will remain in the blister pack). Use a non-hormonal back-up birth control method (like a condom or spermicide) if you have sex during the first 7 days after missing your pills. You do not need to take 1 or more missed green pills. Take the green pill at your next regular time, every day until you finish the pack (this means 1 or more missed green pills will remain the blister pack).\n  Is Slynd right for you?
